Hello, I'm Jerry Chou (xiaokang00010)!

こんにちは、僕は「 Jerry　Chou (Eikou Syuu) 」です！

你好，我是Jerry Chou (xiaokang00010)!

Neiheu, ngo hei Jerry Chou (Zau Winghong)!

I'm a developer on programming languages, but sometimes I will make some insteresting things too.

Just like any otherone, I'm not famous and I'm just a junior high school student.
And my favourite sentence is **Till I saw the ordinary was the only answer.**
It reminded me I'm just one of billions of ordinary persons.
I'm not good at talking with others, and I cannot do well in my study either.
